# parse-write-JSON-files-in-Python
A easy reference for me to use when working with JSON files.


The two functions handle all the events, using the JSON module. It is a built-in module and only needs to be imported, and not installed.


To change the file that is made, simply change the files that are opened in read and write mode.
